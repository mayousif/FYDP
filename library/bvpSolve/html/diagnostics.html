<h2>Prints Diagnostic Characteristics of BVP Solvers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prints several diagnostics of the simulation to the screen, e.g.
conditioning parameters
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
## S3 method for class 'bvpSolve'
diagnostics(obj, ...)
## S3 method for class 'bvpSolve'
approx(x, xout = NULL, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>obj </code></td>
<td>
<p>the output as produced by <code>bvptwp</code>, <code>bvpcol</code> 
or <code>bvpshoot</code>.    
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x </code></td>
<td>
<p>the output as produced by <code>bvpcol</code>    
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xout </code></td>
<td>
<p>points <code>x</code> for which new variable values should 
be generated. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional arguments to the generic function.
</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the integration output is saved as a data.frame, then the required
attributes are lost and method <code>diagnostics</code> will not work anymore.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>S3 method <code>diagnostics</code> prints diagnostic features of the simulation. 
</p>
<p>What exactly is printed will depend on the solution method.
</p>
<p>The diagnostics of all solvers include the 
number of function evaluations, the number of jacobian evaluations, and
the number of steps.  
The diagnostics of both <code>bvptwp</code> and <code>bvpcol</code> also include the 
the number of boundary evaluations and the number of boundary jacobian 
evaluations.
In case the problem was solved with <code>bvpshoot</code>, the diagnostics
of the initial value problem solver will also be written to screen.
</p>
<p>Note that the number of function evaluations are *without* the extra 
calls performed to generate the ordinary output variables (if present). 
</p>
<p>In case the method used was
<code>bvptwp</code>, will also return the <em>conditioning parameters</em>. They are:
kappa, kappa1, kappa2, sigma and gamma1.
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.scpe.org/index.php/scpe/article/view/626">http://www.scpe.org/index.php/scpe/article/view/626</a>
</p>
<p>the kappa's are based on the Inf-norm, gamma1 is based on the 1-norm,
If kappa, kappa1 and gamma1 are  of moderate size, the problem is well
conditioned. If large, the problem is ill-conditioned. If kappa1
is large and gamma1 is small, the problem is ill-conditioned in the
maximum and well conditioned in the 1-norm. This is typical for
problems that involve different time scales (&quot;stiff&quot; problems). If
kappa1 is small and kappa, kappa2 are large the problem  has not the
correct dichotomy.
</p>
<p>S3 method <code>approx</code> calculates an approximate solution vector at points
inbetween the original <code>x</code>-values. If beyond the integration interval,
it will not extrapolate, but just return the values at the edges.
This works only when the solution was generated with <code>bvpcol</code>, and 
usses information in the arrays rwork and iwork, stored as attributes.
The returned matrix will be of class &quot;bvpSolve&quot;
